# 🏠 Zillow Web Scraper – Data Collection Sample

This project demonstrates my ability to extract structured real estate data from complex websites like Zillow using browser automation.

## ✅ Project Summary

- Scraped property listings for San Francisco
- Collected details like:
  - Address
  - Price
  - Bedrooms / Bathrooms
  - Square footage
  - Property type
  - Direct listing link
- Saved to a clean CSV file (see `sample_output.csv`)

> ⚠️ Due to the proprietary nature of the scraping method, the source code is not public.

## 📂 Output Example
